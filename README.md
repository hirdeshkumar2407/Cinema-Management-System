# Cinema-Management-System

We made this Console Application for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project by using Java Programming Language. We made a separate admin and customer panel. Admin can add, update, or delete movies and showtimings. Customers can view movies, daily movie schedules, weekly movie schedules, ticket prices, and cinema types. OPP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation were implemented.
